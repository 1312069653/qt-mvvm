# Example "celleditors".

The example shows how to create editable properties and use various editors
in cells of Qt trees and tables.

The application model contains a collection of `DemoPropertyItem's`, each having 8 properties of 
various types. The tree on the left shows application data in the form of a
standard two-column `name/value` tree. Tree view and table view on the right r
epresent the same data, where rows are formed by `DemoPropertyItem's` and 
columns are made of their properties.

For the moment following cell editors are supported.

+ Boolean editor with a fancy checkbox.
+ Integer editor as standard QSpinBox with a possibility to set limits.
+ Double editor (3 editors are available, have to converge on which one is better).
  + standard QDoubleSpinBox with a possibility to set limits.
  + scientific double editor with the text-like field.
  + scientific double spin box.
+ Color editor.
+ Combo property editor.
  + as standard QComboBox
  + as QComboBox with checkable fields
+ External property editor

The example also demonstrates the following features:

## ExternalProperty

`ExternalProperty` is a special variant carrying the color, the label, and string data. 
It can be used, for example, to call custom external dialog by clicking on a cell, 
containing such variant. Another possible scenario of usage is to save the identifier 
of another `SessionItem` inside this property and so provide cross-links
between items and models.
